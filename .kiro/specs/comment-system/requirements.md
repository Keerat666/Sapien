# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive comment system that allows users to add, view, edit, and delete comments on prompts. The system will track comment metadata including authorship, timestamps, and associations with specific prompts, enabling rich user interaction and feedback capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create comments on prompts, so that I can provide feedback, ask questions, or share insights about specific prompts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a comment with valid content and prompt reference THEN the system SHALL create a new comment record with user ID, prompt ID, content, and timestamp
2. WHEN a user attempts to create a comment without content THEN the system SHALL reject the request and return a validation error
3. WHEN a user attempts to create a comment on a non-existent prompt THEN the system SHALL reject the request and return an error
4. WHEN a comment is successfully created THEN the system SHALL return the complete comment data including generated ID and timestamp

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view comments on prompts, so that I can read feedback and discussions related to specific prompts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests comments for a specific prompt THEN the system SHALL return all comments associated with that prompt ordered by timestamp
2. WHEN a user requests comments for a non-existent prompt THEN the system SHALL return an empty array
3. WHEN a user requests a specific comment by ID THEN the system SHALL return the complete comment data if it exists
4. WHEN a user requests a non-existent comment THEN the system SHALL return a not found error

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to edit my own comments, so that I can correct mistakes or update my feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user updates their own comment with valid content THEN the system SHALL update the comment content and maintain the original timestamp
2. WHEN a user attempts to update another user's comment THEN the system SHALL reject the request with an authorization error
3. WHEN a user attempts to update a comment with empty content THEN the system SHALL reject the request with a validation error
4. WHEN a user attempts to update a non-existent comment THEN the system SHALL return a not found error

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to delete my own comments, so that I can remove content I no longer want to be visible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user deletes their own comment THEN the system SHALL permanently remove the comment from the database
2. WHEN a user attempts to delete another user's comment THEN the system SHALL reject the request with an authorization error
3. WHEN a user attempts to delete a non-existent comment THEN the system SHALL return a not found error
4. WHEN a comment is successfully deleted THEN the system SHALL return a success confirmation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comments to be properly validated and secured, so that the system maintains data integrity and prevents unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any comment operation is performed THEN the system SHALL validate user authentication
2. WHEN comment data is stored THEN the system SHALL enforce maximum content length limits
3. WHEN comment data is retrieved THEN the system SHALL include user information for display purposes
4. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error responses with meaningful messages
